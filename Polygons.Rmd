## Load data and Libraries

```{r crime data}
rm(list=ls())
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(maps)
library(raster)
library(maptools)

crime.data <- read.csv("SFPD_Incidents_-_Previous_Year__2015_.csv")
#crime.locations <- read.csv("crime-coords.csv")
polygon.data <- readOGR(dsn=path.expand("sf-tracts"), layer="sf-tracts")

options(digits=16)

latLong <- function(s,mach,i){
        start <- mach[[1]][i]
        stop <- start + attr(mach[[1]], "match.length")[i]-1
        return(as.numeric(substr(s,start, stop)))
}
```

## Pull crime location and id from crime.data
```{r}
crime.data.locations <- crime.data[,c("IncidntNum","Location")]
crime.locations <- data.frame(lat=c())
crime.point.which.tract <- data.frame(tract=c(character()))

latt <- list()
long <- list()

res = sapply(crime.data.locations$Location, function(z){
  mach <- gregexpr("-?[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+", z)
  lat = latLong(z,mach,1)
  lng = latLong(z,mach,2)
  return (c(lat,lng))
})
res = t(res)
res = as.data.frame(res)
crime.data.locations = data.frame(crime.data.locations, res)
crime.data.locations = crime.data.locations[,c("IncidntNum", "lat","lng")]
#for(i in 1:length(crime.data.locations$Location)){
#    x = crime.data.locations$Location[i]
#    mach <- gregexpr("-?[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+", x)
#    latt[i] <- latLong(x,mach,1)
#    long[i] <- latLong(x,mach,2)
    #I commented the line below becasue rbind operation is very expensive and this takes over an hour to perform. I was trying to reduce this.
    #crime.locations <- rbind(crime.locations, c(lat,long))
#}

# add latt, long, and crime.data.locations$IncidntNum into a data Frame with each as a column to be used later. 

crime.locations = crime.data.locations
#save the file, becasue its expensive to run
write.csv(crime.locations, "crime-coords.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

## Match crime location to a census tract 

```{r}
#create the 4 vectors needed for the point in func

#total polygons: 197 thats. to get each polygon just need to iterrate through  polygon.data@polygons[[HERE]]
pol.y = polygon.data@polygons[[196]]@Polygons[[1]]@coords[,1]#lon for polygon 196 
pol.x = polygon.data@polygons[[196]]@Polygons[[1]]@coords[,2]#lat for polygon 196

#thsi code was set up before I created individual ventors for latt and long in the loop that pulls out teh info. 
point.y <- crime.locations[,"lon"]
point.x <- crime.locations[,"lat"]


#below this line takes in points and 1 polygon and checks if the points are inside the polygon.
#returns vector same size as points with 0 if point not in. also each vaule is sent in as a seperate vector.
#need to itterate through this and add tract number to the point that is in a particular polygon. tract numbers can be found at polygon.data@data$NAME10 upto this point 
points.in <- point.in.polygon(point.x,point.y,pol.x,pol.y, mode.checked = F)


##code below is onlu to plot points and polygon to check that points arw in the polygon selected. points would not plot thogh
pol.max.lat <- max(pol.x) 
pol.min.lat <- min(pol.x)
pol.max.lon <- max(pol.y)
pol.min.lon <- min(pol.y)

crime.locations[points.in,c("lon","lat")]

point.for.plot <- data.frame(crime.points.locations[points.in,])


plot(polygon.data@polygons[[196]]@Polygons[[1]]@coords, col = "firebrick", pch = 5)
points(point.for.plot, col = "blue", pch = "*")

```
